The goal of this exercise is to create simple asset allocation calculator as a small web app.

The app's functionality can be summarized as follows:
 
	"I have $X I want to keep in BTC and ETH, 70/30 split.  How many of each should I buy?"

There is a wireframe at ./asset_allocation_wireframe.png to illustrate how this app might look, but it's not intended to be a high fidelity mock. Feel free to build the best UX you can in the time allotted.
